## Peer instruction

The premise behind undertaking Peer Instruction as a teaching approach is its focus on collaboration, which research in other disciplines has suggested improves girls' engagement. Peer Instruction was developed originally for Physics teaching in Higher Education, with the aims of ensuring that pupils gain a secure understanding of concepts through a teacherâ€™s identification of misconceptions in real-time. It also aims to create a question-driven learning environment that fosters conceptual reasoning and collaboration. Peer Instruction uses a combination of 'flipped learning' and group discussion of multiple choice questions in lessons.

## Research background

Much of the research into Peer Instruction has been carried out at Higher Educational level in Physics but, to date, there has been very little research generated on the impact of Peer Instruction in computing.

[Crouch and Mazur (2001)](https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1119/1.1374249) demonstrated that Peer Instruction leads to significant learning gains for learners: those engaged with Peer Instruction made up to twice as much progress as other learners and retained knowledge better in follow-up quizzes and exams than their peers.

[Porter and colleagues (2016)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2839509.2844642) reported that, once Peer Instruction is part of the regular teaching practice, most students value the teaching approach, recognise its benefits, value the discussion, and would recommend Peer Instruction to their other teachers.

## Peer Instruction and girls

The premise of the Peer Instruction Teaching Approach trial is that the way computing that is taught may not always match the teaching approaches to which girls are most likely to respond ([Goode et al., 2006)](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Lost-in-Translation%3A-Gender-and-High-School-Science-Goode-Estrella/787d7aa31ca0bc201c22597170931e4d2987352c).

So why is Peer Instruction thought to be good for girls?

+ It encourages in-class interactive engagement in learning
+ It enhances cooperation and communication in the classroom among the pupils
+ There is alternation between group discussion and structured teaching and it fosters cooperative, problem-solving activities and raises confidence
+ The activities used reduce competitiveness
+ It applies the subject to a broader world-view and real-world contexts
