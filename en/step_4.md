## Peer Instruction

Peer Instruction has been selected as a teaching approach for this project because of its focus on collaboration, which research in other disciplines has suggested improves girls' engagement. Peer Instruction was developed originally to teach physics in higher education, with the aim of ensuring that students gain a secure understanding of concepts through an educatorâ€™s identification of misconceptions in real time. The approach also aims to create a question-driven learning environment that fosters conceptual reasoning and collaboration. Peer Instruction uses a combination of 'flipped learning' and group discussion of multiple choice questions in lessons.

## Research background

Much of the research into Peer Instruction has been carried out in relation to the teaching of physics in higher education. To date, there has been very little research produced on the impact of Peer Instruction in computing.

[Crouch and Mazur (2001)](https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1119/1.1374249) demonstrated that Peer Instruction leads to significant learning gains: those engaged with Peer Instruction made up to twice as much progress as other learners and retained knowledge better in follow-up quizzes and exams than their peers.

[Porter and colleagues (2016)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2839509.2844642) reported that, once Peer Instruction is part of the regular teaching practice, most pupils value the teaching approach, recognise its benefits, value the discussion, and would recommend Peer Instruction to their other teachers.

## Peer Instruction and girls

The premise of the 'Peer Instruction' Teaching Approach trial is that the way computing is taught may not always match the teaching approaches to which girls are most likely to respond positively to ([Goode et al., 2006)](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Lost-in-Translation%3A-Gender-and-High-School-Science-Goode-Estrella/787d7aa31ca0bc201c22597170931e4d2987352c).

So why is Peer Instruction thought to be good for girls?

+ It encourages in-class interactive engagement in learning
+ It enhances cooperation and communication in the classroom among the pupils
+ There is alternation between group discussion and structured teaching and it uses cooperative, problem-solving activities and raises confidence
+ The activities used reduce competitiveness
+ It applies the subject to a broader world view and real-world contexts
