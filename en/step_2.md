## The Gender Balance in Computing (GBIC) programme

Gender Balance in Computing (GBIC) is a new programme of research to investigate how we can better engage girls in computing and increase the number of girls selecting computer science at GCSE and A level.

It is part of the National Centre for Computing Education (NCCE), which is delivered by a consortium of organisations including the Raspberry Pi Foundation, STEM Learning, and BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT. It is funded by the Department for Education to support computing in schools in England.

The NCCE's vision is for every child in every school in England to have a world-leading computing education. We provide high-quality support for the teaching of computing in schools and colleges, from key stage 1 through to A level. Our extensive range of training, resources, and support covers elements of the curriculum at every key stage, catering for all levels of subject knowledge and experience.

The Gender Balance in Computing programme of research is the largest national research effort to tackle gender balance in computing to date. Trials began in 2019 and will run to 2022 in Key Stages 1 to 4. By the end of 2022, more than 15,000 students and 550 schools will be involved in the programme.

The research is made up of several randomised control trials. Each trial investigates a different intervention that previous research has identified as beneficial to girls' engagement with computing, or with science, technology, engineering, and maths more generally. We have recruited schools for each trial and randomly assigned them into two groups: one group will continue with 'business as usual' and the other will complete the new intervention. Our evaluation partners from the Behavioural Insights Team will collect data about both groups before and after the trial to compare the impact that it has had. This is the best way we know of to understand the impact of new practices in education, and it is the approach that is used in education research across the world. 

The trials focus on:
+ Informal learning (Year 6 in Code Clubs and Year 8 completing the Apps for Good programme): the intervention highlights the links between what pupils learn in informal computing settings and more formal computing education
+ Belonging (Year 5): the intervention targets pupils' sense of belonging in computing by increasing parent understanding of computing education and careers, and introducing role models
+ Relevance (Year 8): the intervention focuses on using computing and technology to solve real-world problems
+ Teaching approach (Years 2, 4, 6, and 8): the intervention focuses on approaches to teaching computing that may engage more girls in computing

You are taking part in the Teaching Approach trial, in which we are evaluating how well approaches that have successfully engaged more girls in other disciplines work in computing. The trial as a whole will include Years 2, 4, 6, and 8, although this project is for teachers working with pupils in Year 8.

The resources have been produced by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, and you can contact us throughout the project if you have any queries. The evaluation of the project is being conducted by the Behavioural Insights Team, and they will contact you during the project to collect data. More information about all of the processes and points of contact will be provided throughout the training sessions.

**The GBIC team at the Raspberry Pi Foundation**
At the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we are working on the GBIC programme in a number of ways. We are recruiting for all of the trials, and you will receive communications about your participation from Katharine Childs. Katharine is your main point of contact for any questions you may have about the project and you can contact her at [genderresearch@raspberrypi.org](mailto:genderresearch@raspberrypi.org). Hayley Leonard is responsible for the day-to-day management of the project, with programme management and implementation led by Sue Sentance, Oliver Quinlan, and Jenny Laidlaw. The resources that you receive for the project have been developed and produced by Emma Posey, with support from Rik Cross and other colleagues working on educational resources across the Foundation.

**Pause and reflect**
What are your experiences of gender balance in computing in your classroom? Do you find that there is a difference in boys' and girls' engagement with computing or their attitudes towards it?
