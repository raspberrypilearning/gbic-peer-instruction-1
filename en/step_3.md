## The Teaching Approach trial

It is important to note that, while the research suggests that these teaching approaches may be particularly beneficial for girls, we expect that a wide range of pupils will benefit. When we talk about boys’ and girls’ attitudes to computing throughout this course, we are basing the discussion on research which has suggested differences on average between them. We recognise that this does not necessarily reflect all pupils’ experiences of computing.

In the Teaching Approach trial, we are asking two key questions:

+ Does structured, collaborative activity in computing lessons make computing more accessible to a range of pupils?
+ Does structured, collaborative activity in computing lessons improve girls’ perception of computing?

In the project, you will use the Peer Instruction teaching approach, which aims to foster collaboration and group discussion. In order to assess whether this teaching approach affects attitudes towards computing, pupils are asked to complete our survey at the beginning and end of the project (Lessons 1 and 12). We will be covering the survey in more detail later in the course, including how pupils may opt out if they choose to do so. Any pupils who have opted out of the research should not complete this survey, but should participate in the lessons as usual.

At the end of the project, we will ask you for your feedback and, in some cases, request to conduct interviews.
