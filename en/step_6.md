## Data collection using the online survey

The data collected for the project will be on students' attitudes to computing before and after implementing the Peer Instruction intervention for 12 weeks (or 12 hours of lessons). As outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding, your school should have sent out information letters to parents/carers to allow them to opt out of data collection on their child's behalf if they wish to.

In order to assess whether this intervention affects attitudes towards computing, you will need to assign time in the first lesson to complete the pre-survey and at the end of the final lesson to complete the post-survey.

The Project Guide also outlines how to explain the data collection to your students so that they can opt out if they do not wish their data to be collected. Any student who has opted out, by their own choice or by their parents'/carers' choice, should not complete the surveys described below. They will, however, take part in lessons as usual, and so will experience the intervention along with the rest of the class.
 
It is really important that both the pre- and post-surveys are completed, because this is how we will measure the effectiveness of the Peer Instruction intervention. 

Students will need to complete the pre- and post-surveys online. Each student will need to complete the survey individually, so they will need their own computer and/or tablet to work on. A link to the survey is given in the [Project Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17sTwXM-oZx3GL-rG6Ctglfqg-ONAW9SaB6p--2Vj99s/edit), as well as at the beginning of the teacher slides for [Lesson 1](https://ncce.io/32M0MZ) and the end of the teacher slides in [Unit 2 Lesson 5](http://ncce.io/ken2FV).

You may need to take some time to read the questions out for students who have difficulty reading them independently, but please ensure that students answer them on their own, in their own words. Try not to lead students to a particular response while helping them to understand the questions.

Survey questions are answered with reference to a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = Strongly disagree to 4 = Strongly agree and are related to students' attitudes and engagement with computing.

At the end of the project, you may be contacted by our colleagues in the Behavioural Insights Team, who may wish to ask you some questions about participating in the project, which is separate from the survey data. Please do respond to them to help us better understand your experience of the research programme.
