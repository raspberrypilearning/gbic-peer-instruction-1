## Session 1: Peer Instruction training â€“ Introduction

Hello, and welcome to the Peer Instruction Teaching Approach project, part of the Gender Balance in Computing programme. In this first session, you will be introduced to the Gender Balance in Computing programme and the Teaching Approach trial, including the Peer Instruction Teaching Approach project.

The online course is split into two sessions. You can access the sessions at different times, or complete the whole course at one time. You will be able to revisit the two sessions until the end of the Peer Instruction project. 
 
The 'Introduction to Peer Instruction' webinar was based on the information in this session, Session 1. However, additional details are provided in this online training, so please do work through this session even if you attended the webinar.
 
If you did not attend the webinar, you can watch the recording or work your way through this session to ensure that you understand the background and emphasis of the project. The recording and slides have been sent to you via email, along with a document outlining key questions and answers from the session.

### Session content

Session 1 focuses on some of the research used as the basis for the project, so that you can better understand why changing your teaching approach could affect the gender balance in computing in your school. The Peer Instruction approach and the research behind it will be introduced, including why Peer Instruction is thought to be engaging for girls. You will also consider some of the practicalities of implementing Peer Instruction in your classroom.

Session 2 allows you time to explore the resources so that you are fully at ease with the content before the project begins. The session also include some hands-on development activities for you to complete in order to further your understanding of the resources and the Peer Instruction approach. This will ensure you have the familiarity you need for you to be able to fully undertake the project. You will need to register your completion of the tasks in a survey at the end of Session 2, as they form part of your engagement in the project.
